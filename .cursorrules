# Cursor AI context

This is an investor research prototype that:
- Processes natural language queries about investors
- Integrates Airtable (existing data) + Apollo.io (external data)
- Generate CSV exports and email drafts
- Creates new proejcts and tracks warm leads

## Key APIs to integrate:
- Airtable API (existing investor database)
- Apollo.io API (external investor data)
- OpenAI API (NLP query processing)
- Gmail API (email drafting)
- Google Calendar API (availability checking)

## Main workflow:
1. Parse natural language query with OpenAI
2. Query Airtable for existing investors
3. Query Apollo.io for additional investors
4. Merge and filter results
5. Generate CSV export
6. Draft email with calendar availability
7. Create new Airtable project with results

When helping with code, focus on FastAPI endpoints, API integrations, and data processing logic.
