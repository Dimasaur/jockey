# Cursor AI context

This is a business intelligence and contact research prototype that:
- Processes natural language queries about companies and people
- Integrates Airtable (existing data) + Apollo.io (external data)
- Generates CSV exports and email drafts
- Creates new projects and tracks warm leads
- Supports flexible search for any business use case

## Key APIs to integrate:
- Airtable API (existing database and project management)
- Apollo.io API (external company and contact data)
- OpenAI API (NLP query processing)
- Gmail API (email drafting)
- Google Calendar API (availability checking)

## Main workflow:
1. Parse natural language query with OpenAI
2. Query Airtable for existing data
3. Query Apollo.io for additional companies/contacts
4. Merge and filter results
5. Generate CSV export
6. Draft email with calendar availability
7. Create new Airtable project with results

## Search Capabilities:
- **Company Search**: Industry, location, employee count, revenue, technologies, funding stage
- **Contact Search**: Job titles, seniority levels, departments, company names
- **Flexible Use Cases**: Investors, customers, partners, competitors, suppliers, etc.

## API Endpoints:
- `POST /orchestrate` - Complete workflow execution
- `POST /search/companies` - Direct company search
- `POST /search/people` - Direct contact search
- `GET /runs/{run_id}` - Get workflow results

When helping with code, focus on:
- FastAPI endpoints and API design
- Apollo.io API integrations (company and people search)
- Natural language query parsing
- Data processing and filtering logic
- CSV export and email generation
- Mock mode for testing
